# Pizza_Analysis_Project
This project analyses fictional pizza shop from a dataset obtained from Kaggle using PostgreSQL and PowerBI to identify key revenue drivers, customer demand patterns, and product performance insights.

Raw transactional data was first modeled and stored in a normalized PostgreSQL schema, reflecting real-world relational database design.Then, analytical views have been created to simplify reporting and connect seamlessly with PowerBI, where an interactive dashboard was built for business decision-making.The project demonstrates practical analytical skills such as data modeling, SQL querying, DAX measures and business-oriented data storytelling which supports my capability as a Business Analyst.

📌 Project Overview

Dataset Source: Kaggle

Tools Used:

PostgreSQL (data modeling & SQL analytics)

Power BI (data visualization & dashboarding)

# Objectives

1. Understand overall sales and revenue performance
2. Gain numerical understanding on how many customers visit each day and explore whether certain times of day experience higher visit
3. Identify performing of pizza products to gain understanding on which products are being preferred by the customers
4. Provide actionable insights to support operational and marketing decisions

Raw transactional CSV files were first transformed into a normalized relational schema in PostgreSQL.
Analytical SQL views were then created to support efficient reporting and seamless integration with Power BI, where an interactive dashboard was built for decision-making.
